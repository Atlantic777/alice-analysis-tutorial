# Obtain the code

Our starting point for these exercises is the example analysis ‘AliAnalysisTaskMyTask.cxx’ that was covered during the lesson. Of course it wouldn’t be very efficient to copy and paste the code for your ‘empty’ analysis task from the slides of the lecture. You can use different methods to obtain it, suggested here in order of adventerousness

1. As we have learned in the previous days, programmers use version control systems for developing their code. Use what you have learned during our GIT lectures, and _clone_ the example task repository. You can find it on [https://github.com/rbertens/ALICE_analysis_tutorial](https://github.com/rbertens/ALICE_analysis_tutorial)

2. The third approach is the most robust: if you have a github account, you can make a _fork_ of the example task repository, by surfing to [https://github.com/rbertens/ALICE_analysis_tutorial](https://github.com/rbertens/ALICE_analysis_tutorial) and clicking on _fork_. If you’ve forked the repository, you can proceed to clone it on your laptop, this allows you to develop the code, and push commits to your own fork

3. The quickest way: download the .tar file that you can find attached to today’s session’s agenda and extract the files to your local hard drive

Whichever approach you chose, the end result should be that you have stored these files on your laptop. One word of caution: _the path in which you store these files cannot contain spaces! E.g. /home/my awesome task/ will not work, use /home/my_awesome_task/_[<sup>1</sup>](#fn1).
