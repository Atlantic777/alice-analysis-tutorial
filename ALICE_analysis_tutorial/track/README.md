# The track loop

In this exercise we are going to study the particles that are produced in each event. Out end goal is to identify charged pions, but first we’ll familiarize ourselves with the analysis code some more.

* plot the pseudorapidity and \phi distributions of the particles for all accepted events in a two-dimensional histogram

* make sure that the axis have proper ranges (how large is the detector?) and a reasonable amount of bins

If you’ve added this histogram, run the analysis, and look at the two dimensional histogram. Does the distribution make sense?
