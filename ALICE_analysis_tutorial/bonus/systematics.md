# Minimal systematics

As you can see in the figure, the TPC signals of different particle species cross eachother. In these regions, it is difficult (or impossible) to identify particles. Because of this ambiguity, we have to estimate what the uncertainty on our identification routine is.

*   run the main code multiple times, varying the number of standard deviations that you require the signal to be in from 3 to 4, and from 3 to 2

*   how do your spectra change? do these changes make sense to you?

If you are very enthousiastic,

*   try to estimate the _systematic uncertainty_ that particle identification introduces to your measurement
