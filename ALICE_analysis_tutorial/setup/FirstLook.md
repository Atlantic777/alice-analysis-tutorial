# A first look at your task

As a start, just take a look at code that makes up the task. You should see the files that were also covered in the first part of the talk:

*   AliAnalysisTaskMyTask.cxx

*   AliAnalysisTaskMyTask.h

*   AddMyTask.C

*   runAnalysis.C

Try to find where all the code snippets that were shown during the presentation fit in, and wonder if you can answer the following questions

*   which function is called for each event?

*   where are the output histogram defined?

*   where are the output histogram filled?

Remember, that for now, the name ‘AliAnalysisTaskMyTask’ doesn’t sound so bad, but when you develop a task ‘in real life’, make sure to give it a meaningful name, that explains what the task is aimed at.
